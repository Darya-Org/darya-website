## Back End

I alwready have developed servers in JS, TS and Rust, but I want do try something diferent. I think is to hard to develop back-end in Rust, and I want some time from JS / TS. So my first idea is to try to use GO to develop this one.

## Front End

[Rust to wasm documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_Wasm)

I don't want to use JS to develop in front-end, so I will use Rust, to develop it with WASM technologies.

## Commands:

build wasm code: `wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ./public/script`

build back-end: `go run .`
